\section{Use Your Words: Designing One-time Pairing Codes toImprove User Experience}

The use of works instead of numerical codes. This is in the context of device pairing in IoT. Something that is new in the literature

Search space required was 500,000,000

Numeric:        9 digits
Alphanumeric:   5 chars
Words:          3 words
