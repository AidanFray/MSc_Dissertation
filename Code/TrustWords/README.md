## Projects

### SimilarWords [C++]
Used to compute the similar word lists for the create_perms.py script.
The program supports different modes used to find similarities between words

### create_perms.py [Python]
Script used to create a list of permutations that can be used to search for near-collisions in GreenOnion.

### Notes
The Android application has a mode to automatically download a PGP key. Is this secure and what server does it query from? What if there is more than one key with the same email address?
