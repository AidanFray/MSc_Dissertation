# Experiment Design

### Rounds
35 (5 at the start always benign)

### Attack Ratio
30/70 Attack to non-attack with there being an equal chance to receive one of three attacks:

    - 0 static words (100,000 perms  - 1   GPU Day)
    - 1 static words (10,000  perms  - 10  GPU Days)
    - 2 static words (1,000   perms  - 100 GPU Days)

NOTE: Number of permutations aim for a 24 hour compute time.

These are defined with attack strength in mind. Where all attack keys will be sampled from a list of keys
found as **vulnerable** with these permutations in mind

Three metrics will also be assessed. The ones chosen will be selected in 
the pilot study.

### Vulnerable keys percentages

TODO

### Data Collection
    - Overall Start/end time
    - Round Start/end time
    - Accept/Decline results
    - User agent
    - Audio button clicks

## Attention metrics
    - Audio button clicks - (i.e. 0 button clicks is a red flag)
    - Time taken (This will require creating a 'reasonable' time)


### Participants and timing

Timing: **3.5 minuites** (TODO: CHECK)

Required participants: **385** (TODO: CHECK)

Payment for completion: **$0.42** 

TOTAL:                  **$161.7**
