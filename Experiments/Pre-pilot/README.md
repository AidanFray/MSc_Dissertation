# Pre-pilot

This initial pilot is to decide which three metrics should be used to quantify similarities in attacks later in the study.

Metrics to asses:

    - [X] Soundex
    - [ ] Metaphone
    - [X] NYSIIS
    - [ ] Match Rating Approach (MRA)
    - [X] Word Vectors (3 Difference)

[TODO] - Need to add functionality to generate random matches

[TODO] - Add into the experiment the odd "attention check"
