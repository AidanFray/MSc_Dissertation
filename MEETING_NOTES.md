### Attack Length
A new attack length for the MainExperiment. Bring along comparison documents and we can compare.

1 day, 2 days, 3 days or 7 days?

### Questions about distributed sampling on a curve
Still confused about the benefits of sampling Word Vector values on a distribution?

Wouldn't I still have issues justifying the central point and number of values to sample?

I've decided to go with Word Vector 4.5

### Whats the process for sorting out the experimentation funding?
Do I need to create an account owned by the university?

### Thesis structure?
What is the basic recommend structure for the report? 

Project title???

Who is my target audience?
