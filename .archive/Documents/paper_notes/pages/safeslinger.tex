\section{SafeSlinger: An Easy-to-use and Secure Approach for
Human Trust Establishment}

The aim of SafeSlinger is to solve the issue of key exchange. They aim to leverage the initial personal contact of people to facilitate trust. To solve the issue of people that would never meet they implement a system of "shared acquaintance"

Talks about issues with decentralised (PGP [42]) and centralised (SSL CA [27, 34]) key exchange.

"Tim Berners-Lee has called upon security researchers and professionals to design a public key encryption system for the people [11]"

Only uses \textbf{24-bits} of a SHA-1 hash of all the exchanged information, \textbf{could this be exploited?}
