"Investigate the Feasibility of Producing Near-Collisions for Hash Functions and Their Application"

## Questions

- What is the probability of producing near-collisions in practice considering the structure and properties of specific hash functions?

- What would be the complexity in storage and computation?

- Can such near-collisions be generated e.g. using the universityâ€™s high-performance computing facilities?
