"Investigate the Feasibility of Producing Near-Collisions for Hash Functions and Their Application"

## Questions

- What is the probability of producing near-collisions in practice considering the structure and properties of specific hash functions?

- What would be the complexity in storage and computation?

- Can such near-collisions be generated e.g. using the universityâ€™s high-performance computing facilities? 

## Topics to consider

### SHA1 for PGP signatures
- Can we harvest keys and notice similarities?

    - How can we harvest keys on mass?

- Can we fiddle with the last block of data for a PGP key and generate some sort of a near collision? Can this done for a target key or a completely random key?

- Structure of a PGP key?

- Are there certain implementations that are more vulnerable?

### Generating Near-Collisions using Marc Steven's code
- How fast is the Universities cluster?

- Using discovered studies is this collision attack feasible?
